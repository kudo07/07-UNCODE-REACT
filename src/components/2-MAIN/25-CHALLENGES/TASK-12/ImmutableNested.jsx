// Shallow Copy Immutability means that only the top-level properties of an object are immutable, while the nested objects or arrays are still mutable. In other words, the immutability does not extend recursively into nested structures.

// Object.freeze is applied to both the top-level data object and the nested address object, making both of them immutable at their respective levels.
// Top-Level Immutability: Using Object.freeze on the data object ensures that its top-level properties cannot be changed.
// Nested Objects: Nested objects are not automatically frozen. If they are not explicitly frozen, their properties can be changed.
// Updates: To update a nested objectâ€™s property in an immutable fashion, you need to create new objects for each level and apply Object.freeze to each of them.
// these side effects will cause re render ans these immutable we nneeed to make a new object for change to ticj the re render
